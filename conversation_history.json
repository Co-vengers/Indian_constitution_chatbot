[{"question": "article 370", "answer": "Article 370, titled \"Temporary provisions with respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir,\" outlines special provisions for the state.  Specifically, it limits Parliament's power to make laws for Jammu and Kashmir, requiring consultation with the state government on matters in the Union and Concurrent Lists.  It also allows for the application of other constitutional provisions to the state subject to exceptions and modifications specified by the President, again with consultation and concurrence from the state government.  Finally, it grants the President the power to declare the article inoperative or operative with modifications, subject to the recommendation of the state's Constituent Assembly.  Essentially, this article provided a degree of autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir.  Note that this article has since been repealed.\n"}]
